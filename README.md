## About the AVL Tree

The AVL tree is a binary search tree that maintains the height balance property. It ensures that the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balancing property guarantees efficient operations with a worst-case time complexity of O(log n) for search, insert, and delete operations.

The implementation provided in this repository includes the following features:

- Insertion: Insert a new key-value pair into the AVL tree while maintaining balance.
- Deletion: Remove a key-value pair from the AVL tree while maintaining balance.
- Search: Find the value associated with a given key in the AVL tree.

The AVL tree class provides methods for performing these operations and maintaining the balance of the tree.
